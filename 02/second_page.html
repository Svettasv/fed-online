      The domestic cat originated from Near-Eastern and Egyptian populations of
      the African wildcat, Felis sylvestris lybica. The family Felidae, to which
      all living feline species belong, arose about ten to eleven million years
      ago and is divided into eight major phylogenetic lineages. The Felis
      lineage in particular is the lineage that the domestic cat is a member
      of.[1] A number of investigations have shown that all domestic varieties
      of cats come from a single species of the Felis lineage, Felis catus.
      Variations of this lineage are found all over the world, and until
      recently scientists have had a hard time pinning down exactly which region
      gave rise to modern domestic cat breeds. Scientists believed that it was
      not just one incident that led to the domesticated cat but multiple,
      independent incidents at different places that led to these breeds. More
      complications arose from the fact that wildcat populations as a whole are
      very widespread and very similar to one another. These variations of
      wildcat can and will interbreed freely with one another when in close
      contact, further blurring the lines between taxa.[2] Recent DNA studies,
      advancement in genetic technologies, and a better understanding of DNA and
      genetics as a whole has helped make discoveries in the evolutionary
      history of the domestic cat. Archaeological evidence has documented
      earlier dates of domestication than formerly believed.
