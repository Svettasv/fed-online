    <a href="second_page.html">Domestication of the cat</a>
    <p>
      The <strong>cat</strong> (<strong
        ><em
          >Felis<sup><a href="#reference_1">[1]</a></sup> catus</em
        ></strong
      >), commonly referred to as the <strong>domestic cat</strong> or
      <strong>house cat</strong>, is the only domesticated species in the family
      Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
      domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is
      commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a
      feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship
      and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws, it is
      adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong,
      flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense
      of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter
      and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like
      meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat
      body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
      human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and
      perceives pheromones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in
      temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter
      sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and
      shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy.
      Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and
      neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
      resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
      extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.

    <p>
      As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United
      States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households
      owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat,
      with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of
      2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats
      in the world.

    <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the
      Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th
      century<sup><a href="#reference_2">[2]</a></sup
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3><em>Size</em></h3>
    <p>
      The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wildcat" target="_blank">
        European wildcat</a
      ><sup><a href="#reference_4">[4]</a></sup> . It averages about 46 cm (18
      in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about
      30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females.[48] Adult
      domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).
    </p>

    <h3><em>Skeleton</em></h3>
    <p>
      Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic
      vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five);
      three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a
      variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to
      five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).[49]: 11 
      The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal
      mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder,
      and the pelvis.[49]: 16  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to
      the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass
      their body through any space into which they can fit their head.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Skull</em></h3>
    <p>
      The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets
      and a powerful specialized jaw.[51]: 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth
      adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a
      cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting
      them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord,
      causing irreversible paralysis and death.[52] Compared to other felines,
      domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of
      their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small
      rodents, which have small vertebrae.
    </p>
    <p>
      The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each
      side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a
      pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars
      cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of
      mastication.[51]: 37  Cats tend to have better teeth than most humans,
      with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of
      enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between
      teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar. Nonetheless, they are subject to
      occasional tooth loss and infection.
    </p>

    <h2>Interaction with humans</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population
      as of 2007 exceeded 500 million.[196] As of 2017, the domestic cat was the
      second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats
      owned[197][198] and around 42 million households owning at least one
      cat.[199] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an
      estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[200] As of 2021,
      there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in
      the world
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur
      trade[206] and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets,
      stuffed toys,[207] shoes, gloves, and musical instruments.[208] About 24
      cats are needed to make a cat-fur coat.[209] This use has been outlawed in
      the United States since 2000 and in the European Union (as well as the
      United Kingdom) since 2007
    </p>
    <p>
      A few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both
      through associations or national and international organizations (such as
      that of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies[213]) and over the
      Internet,[214][215] but such a task does not seem simple to achieve.
      General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely
      from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million.[216][217][218][219][220]
      Walter Chandoha made his career photographing cats after his 1949 images
      of Loco, an especially charming stray taken in, were published around the
      world. He is reported to have photographed 90,000 cats during his career
      and maintained an archive of 225,000 images that he drew from for
      publications during his lifetime<sup><a href="#reference_3">[3]</a></sup
      >.

    <h3><strong>History and mythology</strong></h3>
    <p>
      In ancient Egypt, cats were revered, and the goddess Bastet often depicted
      in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. The
      Greek historian Herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and
      when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their
      eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis,
      where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. Herodotus
      expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only
      ever seen wildcats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Greeks and Romans kept weasels as pets, which were seen as the
      ideal rodent-killers. The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks
      having domestic cats comes from two coins from Magna Graecia dating to the
      mid-fifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary
      founders of Rhegion and Taras respectively, playing with their pet cats.
      The usual ancient Greek word for 'cat' was ailouros, meaning 'thing with
      the waving tail'. Cats are rarely mentioned in ancient Greek literature.
      Aristotle remarked in his History of Animals that "female cats are
      naturally lecherous." The Greeks later syncretized their own goddess
      Artemis with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations
      with cats and ascribing them to Artemis. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, when the
      deities flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess Diana turns into
      a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or
      guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence
      decisions made by humans. In Japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of
      good fortune.[231] In Norse mythology, Freyja, the goddess of love,
      beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.[232]
      In Jewish legend, the first cat was living in the house of the first man
      Adam as a pet that got rid of mice. The cat was once partnering with the
      first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in
      enmity between the descendants of these two animals. It is also written
      that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every
      other animal has an incarnation species in the water.[233] Although no
      species are sacred in Islam, cats are revered by Muslims. Some Western
      writers have stated Muhammad had a favorite cat, Muezza.[234] He is
      reported to have loved cats so much, "he would do without his cloak rather
      than disturb one that was sleeping on it".[235] The story has no origin in
      early Muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later Sufi saint,
      Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, centuries after Muhammad.[236] One of the companions of
      Muhammad was known as Abu Hurayrah ("father of the kitten"), in reference
      to his documented affection to cats.
